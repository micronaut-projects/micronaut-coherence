A Coherence Micronaut application that runs as a cluster member with a gRPC proxy service has two choices when configuring the gRPC server. It can just use the out of the box Coherence gRPC proxy functionality. Or, it can make use of some additional configuration features provided by the Coherence Micronaut API.

This documentation specifically covers the latter case of configuring the gRPC proxy using Micronaut.

=== Add the Coherence gRPC Proxy Dependency

To run a gRPC proxy then Coherence gRPC Proxy module must be added to the project dependencies:

dependency:coherence-grpc-proxy[groupId="com.oracle.coherence.ce",version="21.12.3"]

By default, Coherence will run a simple gRPC server listening on `0.0.0.0:1407`, i.e. bound to port 1407 on all local addresses. If this is sufficient for your application then there is nothing more to configure.


=== Configure the gRPC Server via Application Config

The Coherence gRPC Proxy module allows the gRPC server to be configured using system properties.
When using Coherence Micronaut, these same properties can be configured in the Micronaut application configuration.

For example, to simply change the gRPC port that the server binds to would require setting the `coherence.grpc.server.port` property. Using Micronaut, this can be added to the `coherence` section of the `application.yaml`. The configuration below sets the port to `9099`:

[source,yaml]
.application.yaml
----
coherence:
  grpc:
    server:
      port: 9099
----

See the official Coherence gRPC documentation for more properties that can be set.

=== Custom Server Configuration

If more control over the server configuration is required than that provided out of the box by Coherence, then a Micronaut bean can be created of type link:{coherenceApi}/com/oracle/coherence/grpc/proxy/GrpcServerConfiguration.html[GrpcServerConfiguration].

A Coherence gRPC proxy runs both a gRPC server listening for remote connections, and an in-process gRPC server to allow connections to services from within the same JVM.
The `GrpcServerConfiguration` interface has a `configure` method that allows configuration of both of these servers.

[source,java]
.ServerConfiguration.java
----
@Singleton
public class ServerConfiguration implements GrpcServerConfiguration {

    @Override
    public void configure(ServerBuilder<?> serverBuilder,
            InProcessServerBuilder inProcessServerBuilder) {

        // ToDo: configure the servers...

    }
}
----

The example above shows a simple singleton bean named `ServerConfiguration` that implements `GrpcServerConfiguration`. The `configure` method is called with the `io.grpc.ServerBuilder` to allow full configuration of the gRPC server and also with the `io.grpc.inprocess.InProcessServerBuilder` to allow full control over the in-process server.

Multiple `GrpcServerConfiguration` beans may be present, and if so, all will be called and given a chance to configure the servers.

=== Provide a ServerBuilder

Finally, if the above ways to configure the server still do not give enough flexibility then an application can provide a bean of type `io.grpc.ServerBuilder` which will be used by Coherence to build the gRPC server.

For example, the `ServerBuilderFactory` class below is a simple Micronaut factory that provides a singleton `ServerBuilder` bean from the `createServerBuilder` method.

[source,java]
.ServerBuilderFactory.java
----
import io.grpc.ServerBuilder;

@Factory
public class ServerBuilderFactory {

    @Singleton
    public ServerBuilder<?> createServerBuilder() {
        ServerBuilder<?> builder = ServerBuilder.forPort(nPort);
        // ToDo: add more configuration...
        return builder;
    }
}
----
