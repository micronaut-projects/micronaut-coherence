A link:{coherenceApi}com/tangosol/net/events/partition/TransferEvent.html[TransferEvent] captures information concerning the transfer of a partition for a storage enabled member. Transfer events are raised against the set of link:{coherenceApi}com/tangosol/util/BinaryEntry.html[BinaryEntry] instances that are being transferred.

NOTE: TransferEvents are dispatched to interceptors while holding a lock on the partition being transferred, blocking any operations for the partition. Event observer methods should therefore execute as quickly as possible of hand-off execution to another thread.

To subscribe to `TransferEvent` simply create a Micronaut bean with a listener method annotated with link:{api}/io/micronaut/coherence/annotation/CoherenceEventListener.html[@CoherenceEventListener].
The method should have a single parameter of type `TransferEvent`.

For example, the `onEvent` method below will receive all transaction events emitted by storage enabled cache services in the same JVM.

[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(TransferEvent event) {
    // ToDo: process the event
}
----

=== Receive Specific TransferEvent Types

There are a number of different `TransferEvent` types.

* Arrived - This `TransferEvent` is dispatched when a set of `BinaryEntry` instances have been transferred to the link:{coherenceApi}com/tangosol/net/events/partition/TransferEvent.html#getLocalMember()[local member] or restored from backup.The reason for the event (primary transfer from another member or restore from backup) can be derived as follows:

[source,java]
----
TransferEvent event;
boolean restored = event.getRemoteMember() == event.getLocalMember();
----

Use the link:{api}/io/micronaut/coherence/annotation/Arrived.html[@Arrived] annotation to restrict the received events to arrived type.

* Assigned -  This `TransferEvent` is dispatched when a partition has been assigned to the link:{coherenceApi}com/tangosol/net/events/partition/TransferEvent.html#getLocalMember()[local member]. This event will only be emitted by the ownership senior during the initial partition assignment.
Use the link:{api}/io/micronaut/coherence/annotation/Assigned.html[@Assigned] annotation to restrict received events.

* Departing - This `TransferEvent` is dispatched when a set of `BinaryEntry` are being transferred from the link:{coherenceApi}com/tangosol/net/events/partition/TransferEvent.html#getLocalMember()[local member]. This event is followed by either a `Departed` or `Rollback` event to indicate the success or failure of the transfer.
Use the link:{api}/io/micronaut/coherence/annotation/Departing.html[@Departing] annotation to restrict received events.

* Departed - This `TransferEvent` is dispatched when a partition has been successfully transferred from the link:{coherenceApi}com/tangosol/net/events/partition/TransferEvent.html#getLocalMember()[local member]. To derive the `BinaryEntry` instances associated with the transfer, consumers should subscribe to the `Departing` event that would precede this event.
Use the link:{api}/io/micronaut/coherence/annotation/Departed.html[@Departed] annotation to restrict received events.

* Lost - This `TransferEvent` is dispatched when a partition has been orphaned (data loss _may_ have occurred), and the ownership is assumed by the link:{coherenceApi}com/tangosol/net/events/partition/TransferEvent.html#getLocalMember()[local member]. This event is only be emitted by the ownership senior.
Use the link:{api}/io/micronaut/coherence/annotation/Lost.html[@Lost] annotation to restrict received events.

* Recovered - This `TransferEvent` is dispatched when a set of `BinaryEntry` instances have been recovered from a persistent storage by the link:{coherenceApi}com/tangosol/net/events/partition/TransferEvent.html#getLocalMember()[local member].
Use the link:{api}/io/micronaut/coherence/annotation/Recovered.html[@Recovered] annotation to restrict received events.

* Rollback - This `TransferEvent` is dispatched when partition transfer has failed and was therefore rolled back. To derive the `BinaryEntry` instances associated with the failed transfer, consumers should subscribe to the `Departing` event that would precede this event.
Use the link:{api}/io/micronaut/coherence/annotation/Rollback.html[@Rollback] annotation to restrict received events.

To restrict the `TransferEvent` types received by a method apply one or more of the annotations above to the method parameter. For example, the method below will receive `Lost` events.

[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(@Lost TransferEvent event) {
    // ToDo: process the event
}
----

Multiple type annotations may be used to receive multiple types of `TransferEvent`.


=== Receive TransferEvent from a Specific Cache Service

Caches are owned by a Cache Service, it is possible to restrict events received by a method to only those related to caches owned by a specific service by annotating the method parameter with the
link:{api}/io/micronaut/coherence/annotation/ServiceName.html[@ServiceName] annotation.

The method below will only receive events for the caches owned by the service named `StorageService`:

[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(@ServiceName("StorageService") TransferEvent event) {
    // ToDo: process the event
}
----
