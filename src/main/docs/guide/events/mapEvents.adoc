Listening for changes to data in Coherence is a common use case in applications.
Typically, this involves creating an implementation of a link:{coherenceApi}com/tangosol/util/MapListener.html[MapListener]
 and adding that listener to a `NamedMap` or `NamedCache`. Using Coherence Micronaut makes this much simpler by just requiring Micronaut beans with suitably annotated observer methods that will receive events.

=== MapEvent Observer Methods

A link:{coherenceApi}com/tangosol/util/MapEvent.html[MapEvent] observer method is a method on a Micronaut bean that is annotated with link:{api}/io/micronaut/coherence/annotation/CoherenceEventListener.html[@CoherenceEventListener]. The method has a `void` return type and takes a single method parameter of type `MapEvent`, typically this has the generic types of the underlying map/cache key and value.

For example, assuming that there is a map/cache named `people`, with keys of type `String` and values of type `Person`, and the application has logic that should be executed each time a new `Person` is inserted into the map:

[source,java]
----
import com.tangosol.util.MapEvent;
import io.micronaut.coherence.annotation.*;

@Controller                                                    // <1>
public class PersonController {

    @CoherenceEventListener                                    // <2>
    public void onNewPerson(@MapName("people")                 // <3>
                            @Inserted                          // <4>
                            MapEvent<String, Person> event) {
        // ToDo: process the event
    }
}
----
<1> The `PersonController` is a simple Micronaut bean, in this case a `Controller`.
<2> The `onNewPerson` method is annotated with `@CoherenceEventListener` making it a Coherence event listener.
<3> The `@MapName("people")` annotation specifies the name of the map to receive events from, in this case `people`.
<4> The `@Inserted` annotation specified that only `Inserted` events should be sent to this method.

The above example is very simple, there are a number of other annotations that control what events are received from where.

=== Specify the Map/Cache name

By default, a `MapEvent` observer method would receive events for all maps/caches.
In practice though, this would not be a very common use case and normally an observer method would be for a specific cache.

The Coherence Micronaut API contains two annotations for specifying the map name link:{api}/io/micronaut/coherence/annotation/MapName.html[@MapName], or cache name link:{api}/io/micronaut/coherence/annotation/CacheName.html[@CacheName].
Both annotations take a single `String` value that is the name of the map or cache that events should be received from.

For example,

[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(MapEvent<String, String> event) {
    // ToDo: process the event
}
----
The above method receives events for _all_ caches.

[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(@MapName("foo")  // <1>
                    MapEvent<String, String> event) {
    // ToDo: process the event
}
----
<1> The above method receives events for the map named `foo`.

[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(@CacheName("foo")  // <1>
                    MapEvent<String, String> event) {
    // ToDo: process the event
}
----
<1> The above method receives events for the cache named `bar`.


=== Specify the Cache Service name

As well as restricting the received events to a specific map or cache name, events can be restricted to only events from a specific cache service. In Coherence all caches are owned by a cache service, which have a unique  name.
By default, a `MapEvent` observer method would receive events for a matching cache name on all services.
If an applications Coherence configuration has multiple services, the events can be restricted to just specific services using the link:{api}/io/micronaut/coherence/annotation/ServiceName.html[@ServiceName] annotation.

For example,

[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(@MapName("foo")  // <1>
                    MapEvent<String, String> event) {
    // ToDo: process the event
}
----
<1> The above method receives events for the map named `foo` on _all_ cache services.

[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(@MapName("foo")
                    @ServiceName("Storage")  // <1>
                    MapEvent<String, String> event) {
    // ToDo: process the event
}
----
<1> The above method receives events for the cache named `foo` owned by the cache service named `Storage`.

[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(@ServiceName("Storage")  // <1>
                    MapEvent<String, String> event) {
    // ToDo: process the event
}
----
<1> The above method receives events for the _all_ caches owned by the cache service named `Storage` as there is no `@MapName` or `@CacheName` annotation.


=== Specify the Owning Session name

In applications that use multiple `Sessions` there may be a situation where more than one session has a map with the same name, and an observer method needs to restrict the events it receives to a specific session.
The events can be restricted to `maps` and/or `caches` in specific sessions using the link:{api}/io/micronaut/coherence/annotation/SessionName.html[@SessionName] annotation.

For example,

[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(@MapName("orders")  // <1>
                    MapEvent<String, String> event) {
    // ToDo: process the event
}
----
<1> The above method receives events for the map named `orders` in _all_ sessions.

[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(@MapName("orders")
                    @SessionName("Customer")  // <1>
                    MapEvent<String, Order> event) {
    // ToDo: process the event
}
----
<1> The above method receives events for the map named `orders` owned by the `Session` named `Customer`.

[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(@SessionName("Customer")  // <1>
                    MapEvent<String, Order> event) {
    // ToDo: process the event
}
----
<1> The above method receives events for the _all_ caches owned by the `Session` named `Customer` as there is no `@MapName` or `@CacheName` annotation.

In an application with multiple sessions, events can be routed by session, for example:
[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onCustomerOrders(@SessionName("Customer")  // <1>
                             @MapName("orders")
                             MapEvent<String, Order> event) {
    // ToDo: process the event
}

@CoherenceEventListener
public void onCatalogOrders(@SessionName("Catalog")   // <2>
                            @MapName("orders")
                            MapEvent<String, Order> event) {
    // ToDo: process the event
}
----
<1> The `onCustomerOrders` will receive events for the `orders` map owned by the `Session` named `Customer`.
<2> The `onCatalogOrders` will receive events for the `orders` map owned by the `Session` named `Catalog`.
