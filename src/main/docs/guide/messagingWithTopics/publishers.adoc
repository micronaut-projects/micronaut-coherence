To create a topic Publisher that sends messages you can simply define an interface that is annotated with link:{api}/io/micronaut/coherence/annotation/CoherencePublisher.html[`@CoherencePublisher`].

For example the following is a trivial ``@CoherencePublisher`` interface:

[source,java]
.ProductClient.java
----
import io.micronaut.coherence.annotation.CoherencePublisher;
import io.micronaut.coherence.annotation.Topic;

@CoherencePublisher  // <1>
public interface ProductClient {

    @Topic("my-products") // <2>
    void sendProduct(String message); // <3>

    void sendProduct(@Topic String topic, String message); // <4>
}
----

<1> The `@CoherencePublisher` annotation is used to designate this interface as a message publisher.
<2> The `@Topic` annotation indicates which topics the message should be published to
<3> The method defines a single parameter, which is the message value. In this case the values being published are String instances, but they could be any type that can be serialized by Coherence.
<4> It is also possible for the topic to be dynamic by making it a method argument annotated with .

At compile time Micronaut will produce an implementation of the above interface. You can retrieve an instance of `ProductClient` either by looking up the bean from the `ApplicationContext` or by injecting the bean with `@Inject`:

[source,java]
.Using ProductClient
----
ProductClient client = applicationContext.getBean(ProductClient.class);
client.sendProduct("Blue Trainers");
----

Note that since the sendProduct method returns void this means the method will send the message and block until the message has been sent. You can return a `Future` to support non-blocking message delivery.

=== Reactive and Non-Blocking Method Definitions

The `@CoherencePublisher` annotation supports the definition of reactive return types (such as link:http://reactivex.io/RxJava/2.x/javadoc/io/reactivex/Flowable.html[Flowable] or Reactor `Flux`) as well as Futures.

The following sections cover possible method signatures and behaviour:

==== Single Value and Return Type

[source,java]
----
Single<Book> sendBook(Single<Book> book);
----

The implementation will return a link:http://reactivex.io/RxJava/2.x/javadoc/io/reactivex/Single.html[Single] that when subscribed to will subscribe to the passed link:http://reactivex.io/RxJava/2.x/javadoc/io/reactivex/Single.html[Single] and send the emitted item as a message emitting the item again if successful or an error otherwise.

==== Flowable Value and Return Type

[source,java]
----
Flowable<Book> sendBooks(Flowable<Book> book);
----

The implementation will return a link:http://reactivex.io/RxJava/2.x/javadoc/io/reactivex/Flowable.html[Flowable] that when subscribed to will subscribe to the passed link:http://reactivex.io/RxJava/2.x/javadoc/io/reactivex/Flowable.html[Flowable] and for each emitted item will send a message emitting the item again if successful or an error otherwise.

==== Reactor Flux Value and Return Type

[source,java]
----
Flux<RecordMetadata> sendBooks(Flux<Book> book);
----

The implementation will return a Reactor `Flux` that when subscribed to will subscribe to the passed `Flux` and for each emitted item will send a message emitting the resulting message if successful or an error otherwise.
