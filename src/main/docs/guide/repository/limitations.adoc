As Coherence is ultimately a key/value store, there are some limitations using the generated query facility offered
by Micronaut.

The following auto generated query types/features are not supported

* ``JOIN``
* ``ORDER BY``; the statement will compile, however, it currently has no effect in Coherence's query language.  For
the time being, use the APIs offered by the Coherence Repository abstract class.
* pagination; this means you should not use ``Page`` or ``Slice`` as return types for such queries
* When extending the Coherence Data `CoherenceAbstractRepository`, it *must not* implement any other Micronaut Data
interfaces
(e.g., ``CrudRepository``, etc.)
