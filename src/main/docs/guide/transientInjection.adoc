Using Micronaut to inject Coherence objects into your application classes, and Micronaut beans into Coherence-managed objects will
allow you to support many use cases where dependency injection may be useful, but it doesn't cover an important use
case that is somewhat specific to Coherence.

Coherence is a distributed system, and it uses serialization in order to send both the data and the  processing requests
from one cluster member (or remote client) to another, as well as to store data, both in memory and on disk.

Processing requests, such as entry processors and aggregators, have to be deserialized on a target cluster member(s) in
order to be executed. In some cases, they could benefit from dependency injection in order to avoid service lookups.

Similarly, while the data is stored in a serialized, binary format, it may need to be deserialized into user supplied
classes for server-side processing, such as when executing entry processors and aggregators. In this case, data classes
can often also benefit from dependency injection (in order to support Domain-Driven Design (DDD), for example).

While these transient objects are not managed by the Micronaut container, Coherence Micronaut does support their injection during
deserialization, but for performance reasons requires that you explicitly opt in by implementing
`com.oracle.coherence.inject.Injectable` interface.

=== Making transient classes Injectable

While not technically a true marker interface, `com.oracle.coherence.inject.Injectable` can be treated as such for
all intents and purposes.
All you need to do is add it to the `implements` clause of your class in order for injection on deserialization to
kick in:

[source,java]
----
public class InjectableBean
        implements Injectable, Serializable {

    @Inject
    private Converter<String, String> converter;

    private String text;

    InjectableBean() {
    }

    InjectableBean(String text) {
        this.text = text;
    }

    String getConvertedText() {
        return converter.convert(text);
    }
}
----

Assuming that you have the following `Converter` service implementation in your application, it will be injected
into `InjectableBean` during deserialization, and the `getConvertedText` method will return the value of the `text`
field converted to upper case:

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class ToUpperConverter
        implements Converter<String, String> {
    @Override
    public String convert(String s) {
        return s.toUpperCase();
    }
}
----

NOTE: If your `Injectable` class has `@PostConstruct` callback method, it will be called after the injection.
However, because we have no control over object's lifecycle after that point, `@PreDestroy` callback will *never* be called).

You should note that the above functionality is not dependent on the serialization format and will work with both
Java and POF serialization (or any other custom serializer), and for any object that is  deserialized on any Coherence
member (or even on a remote client).

While the deserialized transient objects are not true Micronaut managed beans, being able to inject Micronaut managed dependencies
into them upon deserialization will likely satisfy most dependency injection requirements you will ever have in those
application components.
