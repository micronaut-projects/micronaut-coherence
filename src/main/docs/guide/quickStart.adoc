To add support for Oracle Coherence to an existing project, you should first add the Micronaut Coherence configuration to your build configuration. For example:

dependency:coherence[groupId="io.micronaut.coherence"]

Next, you also need to add the version of Coherence that your application will be using. For example, to use Coherence CE:

dependency:coherence[groupId="com.oracle.coherence.ce",version="22.06"]

NOTE: Coherence CE 22.06 and newer require JDK 11 as a minimum!

or to use a commercial version Coherence:

dependency:coherence[groupId="com.oracle.coherence",version="14.1.1-0-1"]

NOTE: Coherence CE versions are available from Maven Central.
Commercial versions of Coherence need to be uploaded into your own Maven repository.

There is no minimal configuration required to bootstrap Coherence.
If no specific configuration is provided Coherence will run with default values.
Some Coherence functionality can be configured using System properties. Add these properties to the application configuration file, for example:

[configuration, title = 'Configure Coherence']
----
coherence:
  cluster: test-cluster
  role: storage
----

The above configuration sets the cluster name to `test-cluster`, and the role name to `storage`.
Any Coherence system property (prefixed with `coherence.`) specified in the Micronaut configuration
will then be picked up by Coherence at runtime.
