The simplest configuration, applicable to the majority of applications that only require a single `Session`, is
to just configure and use the default `Session`. If the application is a Coherence cluster member, or a Coherence*Extend client,
then all that needs to be specified is the Coherence configuration file name (although even this is optional as
Coherence will use a default file name if none is configured).
Alternatively, if the application is a Coherence gRPC client, the default Session can be configured as a gRPC Session
(see the <<grpc,gRPC documentation>>).

As already mentioned in the <<quickStart,Quick Start>> section, the name of the Coherence configuration file for the default session can be set in the Micronaut config, for example in the `application.yaml` file:

[source,yaml]
.application.yaml
----
coherence:
  sessions:
    default:
      config: coherence-config.xml
