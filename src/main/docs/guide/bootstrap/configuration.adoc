There are a number of fields that may be used to configure a `Session`, all of them are optional.

=== Configuration File Name

As already mentioned, the most common configuration to set will be the Coherence configuration file name.
This is set using the `config` property.
If not specified, the default value will be `coherence-cache-config.xml`.

[configuration]
----
coherence:
  sessions:
    default:
      config: coherence-config.xml
----

=== Scope Name

A scope name is typically used in an application where the Coherence cluster member has multiple sessions.
The scope name is used to keep the sessions separate. The scope name will be applied to the session's underlying
`ConfigurableCacheFactory` and used to scope Coherence services. In this way multiple session configurations may use identical service names, which will be kept separate using the scope.
On a Coherence cluster member each session should have a unique scope name.

In a client application, for example, a gRPC client, the scope name is used to map a client session to a corresponding scoped server session.

[configuration]
----
coherence:
  sessions:
    catalog:
      scope: Catalog
      config: catalog-config.xml
    customer:
      scope: Customer
      config: customer-config.xml
----

In the above example there are two sessions, `catalog` and `customer`. The `catalog` session has a scope name of `Catalog`, and the `customer` session` has the scope name `Customer`.

In a client application there might only be a single default session but this session needs to connect to a server that has multiple sessions configured.
In this case the scope name is used to identify the server side session.

For example, assuming that the server is using the configuration above, with two sessions, `catalog` and `customer`.
The client application only needs to connect to the `catalog` session, so it can be configured with a default session like this:

[configuration]
----
coherence:
  sessions:
    default:
      scope: Catalog
      config: client-config.xml
----

=== Session Type

There are three different types of session that can be configured:

* `server` represents storage enabled cluster member session.
* `client` represents a storage disabled cluster member or Coherence*Extend client session.
* `grpc` is a gRPC client session (see the <<grpc,gRPC documentation>>).

The type of the session affects how the bootstrap API starts the session. The session type is configured with the `type`
property:

[configuration]
----
coherence:
  sessions:
    default:
      type: client
      scope: Catalog
      config: client-config.xml
----
- In this example the default session is a client session.
