Micronaut Data is a database access toolkit that uses Ahead of Time (AoT) compilation to pre-compute queries for repository interfaces that are then executed by a thin, lightweight runtime layer.

Micronaut Data is inspired by GORM and Spring Data, however improves on those solutions in the following ways:

* No runtime model - Both GORM and Spring Data maintain a runtime metamodel that uses reflection to model relationships between entities.
This model consumes significant memory and memory requirements grow as your application size grows.
The problem is worse when combined with Hibernate which maintains its own metamodel as you end up with duplicate metamodels.

* No query translation - Both GORM and Spring Data use regular expressions and pattern matching in combination with runtime generated proxies to translate a method definition on a Java interface into a query at runtime.
No such runtime translation exists in Micronaut Data and this work is carried out by the Micronaut compiler at compilation time.

* No Reflection or Runtime Proxies - Micronaut Data uses no reflection or runtime proxies, resulting in better performance, smaller stack traces and reduced memory consumption due to a complete lack of reflection caches (Note that the backing implementation, for example Hibernate, may use reflection).

* Type Safety - Micronaut Data will actively check at compile time that a repository method can be implemented and fail compilation if it cannot.

This integration allows using Coherence as a data source for a Micronaut

In addition to the above, this library provides abstract synchronous and asynchronous

that expose the power of Coherence when not using generated queries.

This documentation assumes with principals of Micronaut Data as described https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-data/latest/guide/#introduction[here].
