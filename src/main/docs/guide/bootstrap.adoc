The default behavior of the Coherence Micronaut framework is to use the Coherence bootstrap API introduced in Coherence CE `20.12` to configure and create Coherence instances.
This means that Coherence resources in a Micronaut application are typically owned by a Coherence `Session`.

By default, Coherence will start a single Session configured to use the default Coherence configuration file.
This behaviour can easily be configured, either traditionally using Coherence system properties or using explicit Micronaut
configuration.

IMPORTANT: When using Micronaut, all Coherence resources used by application code should be injected.
Applications should avoid calling Coherence APIs that create or initialise Coherence resources directly,
especially static CacheFactory methods. If application code calls these Coherence APIs it may cause Coherence to
be initialised too early in the start-up process before the Micronaut framework has initialised the Coherence
extensions. A typical symptom of this would be that Coherence starts without picking up the correct configuration
from the Micronaut framework.
