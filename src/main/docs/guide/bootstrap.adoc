The default behavior of the Coherence Micronaut framework is to use the Coherence bootstrap API introduced in Coherence CE `20.12` to configure and create Coherence instances.
This means that Coherence resources in a Micronaut application are typically owned by a Coherence `Session`.

By default Coherence will start a single Session configured to use the default Coherence configuration file.
This behaviour can easily be configured, either traditionally using Coherence system properties or using explicit Micronaut
configuration.
