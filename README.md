## Snapshots and Releases

Snapshots are automatically published to [Sonatype OSS]("https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/") using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-coherence/actions).

See the documentation in the [Micronaut Docs](https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#usingsnapshots) for how to configure your build to use snapshots.

Releases are published to Maven Central via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-coherence/actions).

Releases are completely automated. To perform a release use the following steps:

* [Publish the draft release](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-coherence/releases). There should be already a draft release created, edit and publish it. The Git Tag should start with `v`. For example `v1.0.0`.
* [Monitor the Workflow](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-coherence/actions?query=workflow%3ARelease) to check it passed successfully.
* Celebrate!
